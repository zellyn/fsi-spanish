This is a transcription of the FSI Basic Spanish Course found at
[[http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php?page=Spanish+Basic][FSI-Language-Courses.org]], with the multiple aims of:
- dramatically reducing file sizes: the PDFs are huge scans
- getting everything in a machine-readable format that can be used to
  generate web pages, mobile apps, etc.

As I understand it, the material is in the public domain.
