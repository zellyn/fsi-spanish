<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><u>Foreign Service Institute - Spanish Basic Course</u> was first
printed in 1957. The Foreign Service Institute School of Languages
would have preferred to revise the text for this second printing, but
the requirements of day to day training have forced a postponement of
the task. The revisions contemplated would have affected primarily the
pedagogical design ratehr than the analysis of Spanish structure. In
any case the book remains thoroughly useful and usable.</p>

<p>This book was prepared specifically to train officers of the
Foreign Service andof other United States Government agencies who are
involved in foreign affairs and who need to learn to
<u>speak</u> Spanish.</p>

<p>The course is designed to be taught by a native speaker of Spanish
who has received trainign specifically in the sue of such materials
and who teaches under the supervision of a scientific
linguist. Spanish classes at the Foreign Service Institute normally
contain six students who recieve six hours of class drill daily and
are expected to do at least two hours a day of preparation, mostly
practice with tapes. With this schedule average students at the
Institute require approximately two to two and a half days to
assimilate one Unit thoroughly. The Institute believes that the text
can be useful in other teaching contexts, with the important provisos
that the instruction be carefully supervised by an experienced
professional person, preferably with training in linguistics, and that
full use be required of the tapes.</p>

<p>The text and accompanying tape recordings are also used in
part-time training programs in Washington and overseas. Although they
are not designed for this purpose, they are also used occasionally for
individual self-study.</p>

<p>This manual has been prepared and reviewed by members of fifteen
different Spanish-speaking countries representing every major dialect
area of the Hispanic world. While it is broadly representative of
general Latin-American Spanish, it is readily adaptible to any
particular area.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The materials in this book have been developed to present Spanish
as a spoken language, and the skills of understanding and speaking are
accordingly emphasized. The method of presentation will likely be new
to students acquainted with more traditional methods of language
teaching. In order to understand the materials, one must first
understand the method upon which they are built.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-method_of_teaching">Method of Teaching</h3>

<p>The method is known as <span class="keyword">guided
imitation</span>. It may appear to be new, but actually it has been
used by a considerable number of teachers for many years, though its
greatest popularity has come since the second World War. Its goal is
to teach one to speak easily, fluently, with very little accent, and
to do this without conscious effort, just as one speaks his own
language without conscious effort.</p>

<p>There are two very important aspects of this method. First,
learning a relatively small body of material so well that it requires
very little effort to produce it. This
is <span class="keyword">overlearning</span>. If a student overleans
every dialog and drill as he goes through this book, he will almost
certainly experience rapid progress in learning the language.</p>

<p>The second aspect is learning to <u>authentically</u> manipulate
the sounds, sequences, and patterns of the language. The important
implication here is the reality of both the model and the
imitation. The model (teacher, recording, etc.) must provide Spanish
as people really speak it in actual conversations, and the student
must be helped to an accurate imitation. Above all, the normal tempo
of pronunciation must be the classroom standard; slowing down is, in
this context, distortion.</p>

<p>The complete course consists of sixty units, each requiring sorne
ten class and laboratory hours plus outside study to master. The
course is a six-hundred-hours course which may be studied intensively
over a period of about six months, or may be spread at the rate of a
unit a week over a period of sixty weeks (four college
semesters). Either a native speaker or a teacher with very little
accent in his Spanish is necessary as the model for imitation.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-pronunciation">Pronunciation</h3>

<p>The first two units are focused primarily on pronunciation
problems. Drills on other aspects of the language are deliberately
postponed because of the importance of developing good pronunciation
habits from the very beginning of the course. Pronunciation is
extremely important. It is the basis of all real fluency. A person is
readily able to understand anything he can meaningfully say himself,
if the correlation between the way he hears it and the way he says it
is reasonably similar. Probably the more similar, the greater the ease
of comprehension.</p>

<p>The basis of the student's imitation is of course the teacher,
whose pronunciation, if he is a native speaker of an acceptable
dialect of his own country, is the ultimate source of authority. The
fundamental classroom procedure for learning new material throughout
this book (except the reading materials) is repetition by the student
in direct <u>immediate imitation</u> after the teacher. The imitative
repetition may at first be done in chorus after the teacher, and
subsequently by each individual, or it may be individualized from the
start. In either case the student should wait for the teacher's model.
Imitating after another student too frequently results in compounding
the errors of both. If a person is fortunate enough to begin studying
a second language before the age of eight or ten, the powers of
imitation are normally sufficient to insure excellent results in
pronunciation without resorting to technical explanations of what
happens to various parts of the vocal apparatus. If occasionally an
individual has managed to retain this gift that all of us had in
childhood, so much the better, but most adults need more specific
guidance based on an awareness of the particular problems of producing
particular sounds. The drills and explanations in the first two units
are devoted to the specific problems an English speaker with his
English habits of pronunciation will have in accurately imitating the
sounds and sequences <span class="elide">of sounds</span> of Spanish.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-aids_to_listening">Aids to Listening</h3>

<p>If speakers of English were not so highly literate, it might be
possible to teach effectively without reference to any written
symbolization, but most students are much more comfortable if some
kind of representation of what they are imitating is also available
for visual reference. There is, of course, a traditional writing
system for Spanish which is used in all parts of the Spanish speaking
world. It is a very adequate system for its purpose, which might be
stated as providing visual cues for persons who already speak the
language. For pedagogical purposes, a respelling, or phonetic
representation of Spanish is also provided as a means of reminding the
student of important features of the pronunciation which the
traditional spelling system does not provide, such as significant
sound distinctions, word groupings, intonation patterns, etc. The
phonetic symbolization may at first look unfamiliar and somewhat
foreboding, but this very unfamiliarity is a healthy reminder that
none of the English sounds (which are so easily associated with the
familiar letters of the alphabet) are exact duplications of the
Spanish sounds to be mastered. This is also, of course, true in the
respelling when familiar symbols are used: the appearance of the
letter <u>t</u> does not mean the familiar English <u>t</u>-sound is
indicated.</p>

<p>The intonations are marked in the respelling by a system of dots
and accents placed at relative heights over the vowels. The patterns
recorded in this way are not necessarily the only possibilities in
spoken Spanish, but they are all normal patterns which have been
thoroughly and widely tested.</p>

<p>The symbolization in the respel11ng will allow for a consistent
interpretation of the pronunciation of any dialect area of the Spanish
speaking world. For example, the [[/\,s/]] symbol is to be
interpreted as a sound similar to the 's' of 'sink' in Spanish
America, but as the 'th' of 'think' in Central Spain. other regional
pronunciation features are similarly marked.</p>

<p>The acquisition of a good pronunciation is first of all the result
of careful listening and imitation plus whatever help can be obtained
from initial pronunciation drills and description, and from the cues
provided for continuing reference by the aids to listening. It is well
to remember that a sizeable investment in pronunciation practice early
in the course will pay handsome dividends later; correct pronunciation
safely relegated to habit leaves one's full attention available for
other problems of learning the language.</p>

<p>Every unit (after the first two) is organized in the same way: part
one is the basic dialog with a few pertinent notes; part two is
grammar drills and discussion; part three is a set of recombination
narratives and dialogues; part four, beginning in Unit 16, is
readings.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-basic_dialogs">Basic Dialogs</h3>

<p>The basic dialogs are the core of each unit. These dialogs are
recreations of the real situations a student is most likely to
encounter, and the vocabulary and sentences are those he is most
likely to need. The dialogs are set in a mythical country called
<u>Surlandia</u>, which is described as a typical Latin American
republic, insofar as it is possible to extract common features from so
diverse an area. To further provide information in context, many of
the notes suggest regional differences in both the language and the
culture that will be encountered in various areas of Latin America and
in Spain.</p>

<p>In the first part of the book new vocabularly is introduced mainly
in the basic dialogs. Occasionally, in the illustrations of grammar
points, new words are introduced in order to fill out patterns needed
to do the exercises. New words are always clearly indicated by placing
them on a line themselves, indented between the lines that are
complete sentences. Since each new word is introduced in this fashion
only once, the student should take pains to be sure he learns each
word as it is presented. Careful pains have been taken to see that
each word introduced will reappear many times later in the course, to
help the student assimilate each word in a variety of contexts.</p>

<p>The student should very carefully learn both the literal meanings
of each individual word or phrase that is given on an indented line
and the meaning that appears in the full sentences. It should not be
cause for concern if the meaning in context is strikingly different
from the literal meaning. In the construction of each dialog, the
Spanish was written first, and the corresponding English is its
closest equivalent and not a literal translation. It is therefore not
at all surprising if the Spanish does not seem to 'follow' the
English.</p>

<p>The student should learn the basic dialogs by heart. If they are
committed perfectly to rote memory, the drills will go easily and
rapidly. Roughly half of the estimated ten hours that are spent in
class on each unit should normally be devoted to the basic
dialogs.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-drills_and_grammar">Drills and Grammar</h3>

<p>Each unit can in some ways be likened to a musical theme with
variations. The basic dialogs are the theme, and the drills provide
the variations. Patterns of the structure of the language which have
been learned in the basic sentences are expanded and manipulated in
the drills.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of drills in each unit (three befare Unit
6). Of these, two are designed to systematically vary selected basic
sentences within the structure and vocabulary the student has already
learned. And two are oriented toward the structure of the language to
provide a systematic coverage of all important patterns.</p>

<p>All of these drills are planned to be easily and rapidly
answered. They can be done orally and with only the teacher's book
open. The method of conducting the drill is clearly shown by the
format of the text, and all answers are available for the teacher's
convenience and for the student to refer to when studying outside of
class. If a drill is found to be hard, the difficulty probably
reflects inadequacy in the mastery of the dialogs and earlier
drills. The drills are not problems to be worked out like mathematics,
and the ability to do them, not to figure them, is indicated by the
nature of the course. There are no tricks in them, and they are not
intended as tests.</p>

<p>Pattern drills are presented in a format which provides both
practice and explanation. First appears a presentation of the pattern
to be drilled, then various kinds of drills, and finally a more
detailed discussion of the pattern.</p>

<p>The presentation consists of a listing of basic sentences (and a
few new sentences when necessary) which illustrate the grammar point
to be drilled. Then there is an extrapolation which shows the
relationships involved in the pattern in a two-dimensional chart,
which is further explained by a short note or two. This presentation
should provide sufficient clues to enable the student to understand
and use the pattern correctly in the drills that follow.</p>

<p>These drills are mainly exercises making substitutions, responses,
and translations, highlighting the grammar points covered. They are
devised for oral answers to oral stimuli.</p>

<p>After the drills there is a more detailed discussion of the pattern
drilled. These descriptions are written in a condensed and somewhat
technical fashion. While an effort was made to keep these discussions
clear and readable, it has to be recognized that a description of a
language is a technical subject, and simplification can only be
attained by sacrificing accuracy or at a cost of a great many more
words than space allows. The student who works through these
discussions by a careful reading will find that he is acquiring a set
of analytical tools that will be useful throughout the remainder of
his career of interest in language.</p>

<p>The student may notice slight differences in the respelling used in
the aids to listening and in the grammar charts and discussions. The
respelling useful as a guide to pronunciation for an English speaking
student, records more details than a respelling to be used in grammar
discussions where comparisons are made between Spanish forms, not
between English and Spanish pronunciation.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-conversation">Conversation</h3>

<p>The conversation section of each unit is designed to help bridge
the gap between the more or less mechanical stimulus-response activity
of the drills and the skill of free conversation which is the ultimate
aim of the course. These recombination monologues and dialogs extend
the abilities of the student into ever more natural situations. The
narrative is an anecdote type description of an event or situation
which isthen recast as a directed dialog in which the teacher acts as
a prompter for students who take the parts as the actcrs. The prompter
gradually withdraws his help so that in the end the conversation is
carried on freely.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-readings">Readings</h3>

<p>Beginning with unit 16 reading materials are introduced for outside
preparation with perhaps some classroom discussion of the questions
provided. These readings can also be used to provide content
information for oral surmnaries.</p>

<p>Up through unit 30 the readings tell a continued story about an
American family living in Surlandia, expanding on matters of interest
hinted at in the basic dialogs. These require no new vocabularly
except for easy and obvious cognate loan words that can readily be
guessed. From unit 31 through 60 the readings are much longer
and <u>do</u> introduce a considerable number of new words. This
vocabulary is introduced through basic sentences which summarize the
content of the following reading.</p>

<p>The readings are designed to provide information of interest and
value about the culture which the Spanish language reflects and to
provide insight into the practical problems an American is likely to
encounter in adjusting to life in a Hispanic area.</p>
